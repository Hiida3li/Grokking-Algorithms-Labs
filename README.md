# Grokking Algorithms: Real-World Labs

This is not a collection of textbook answers.
It is a **translation layer**. I am taking the core concepts from *Grokking Algorithms (2nd Ed)* and reimplementing them as **Production Utilities** using Python.

**Goal:** To move beyond "LeetCode" style puzzles and understand how algorithms power real backend systems (Log analysis, Caching, Routing, etc.).
