# Grokking Algorithms: Real-World Labs

This is not a collection of textbook answers.
It is a **translation layer**. I am taking the core concepts from *Grokking Algorithms (2nd Ed)* and reimplementing them as **Production Utilities** using Python.

**Goal:** To move beyond "LeetCode" style puzzles and understand how algorithms power real backend systems (Log analysis, Caching, Routing, etc.).

##  The Labs

| Day | Topic | Real-World Application | Status     |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:-----------|
| **01** | Binary Search | **Log Hunter:** Finding 1 transaction in 10M logs | Completed  |
| **02** | Selection Sort | **Music Sort:** Why O(n²) kills page load speed | Completed  |
| **03** | Recursion | **The Crawler:** Searching deep nested directories | Completed  |
| **04** | Quicksort | **The Divide:** Optimizing large data processing | Completed  |
| **05** | Hash Maps | **API Caching:** Building a Redis-lite layer |  Pending   |
