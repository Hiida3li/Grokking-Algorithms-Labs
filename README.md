#  Grokking Algorithms: Real-World Labs


This is not a collection of textbook answers.
It is a **translation layer**. I am taking the core concepts from *Grokking Algorithms (2nd Ed)* and reimplementing them as **Production Utilities** using Python.

To move beyond "LeetCode" style puzzles and understand how algorithms power real backend systems (Log analysis, Caching, Routing, etc.).

##  The Labs

| Day | Topic | Real-World Application | Status    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:----------|
| **01** | Binary Search | **Log Hunter:** Seeking timestamps in 10GB logs |  Pending  |
| **02** | Recursion | **The Crawler:** Nested directory traversal |  Locked |
| **03** | Hash Maps | **API Caching:** Building a Redis-lite layer |  Locked |
